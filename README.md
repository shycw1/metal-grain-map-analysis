# Metal Grain Analysis from Crystallographic Images
Using Convolutional Neural Networks


This project developed robust deep learning based approach for automated metallic
grain map analysis using convolutional neural networks to predict mean grain size
and grain number from metal crystallographic images. Traditional computer vision
algorithms are limited by manual tuning of parameters and thresholds and are
sensitive grain map noise, grain structure and average size. To overcome these
limitations, this project developed robust CNN-based models that demonstrated
excellent prediction accuracy, and also investiaged transfer learning, and introduced
multi-output regression models for simultaneous grain size and number predictions.
In this project, Voronoi tessellation simulations were developed to generate grain
color maps due to the lack of large grain map datasets. The proposed approach
demonstrated improved performance and efficiency compared to conventional
techniques, offering a reliable solution for grain structure analysis for metallic
materials.
